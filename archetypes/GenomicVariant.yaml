name: Genomic variant
definedBy: NCIT:C17248
definedAs: Genetic Variation; Genetic Variation consists of deviation(s) in the nucleotide sequence of the genetic material of an individual from that typical of the group to which the individual belongs, or deviation(s) in the nucleotide sequence of the genetic material of offspring from that of its parents.
identifier:
