tables:
  - NonPatients:
      archetype: Subject
  - Patients:
      #we allow another name then Subject because we treat this as a 'dataset of Subject'. There can be more than one
      # assume that the software will allow me to query ALL instances of Subject. So for us 'Patients' is just a subset filter.
      archetype: Subject, ClinicalObservation #is also a Subject then? Overlapping fields well be merged. Conflicting fields not allowed.
      standardsSupported:
        - beaconv2 #so we can validate that the columnss required are indeed present
      columns:
        - name: Identifier
          #we now propose that fields that are on both archetypes should be same; alternatively we could make explicit what archetype will be used, e.g. Subject.Identifier
          type:
          description: if you provide a type then you are not using the archetype. You are forbidden to use column names already defined in archetype.
        - name: Genotypic sex
          required: true
          label: sex
        - name: parent #so this is a self reference to Subject. What will it refer to in context of COSAS???
          refScope: Patients,NonPatients #so both these must be of archetype Subject, otherwise we error?
